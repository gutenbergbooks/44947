<h2>THE PURPOSE</h2>


<div class='unindent'>of this little book is to procure funds in aid of the
farmers in that part of France which was devastated
by the invasion of the German armies and
subsequently regained by the French.</div>

<p>This region, in part, one of the most fertile in
France, and which sustained hundreds of thousands
of inhabitants engaged in agricultural pursuits,
has been left desolate, with all buildings destroyed
and all farming implements, cattle, and farm products
taken off by the invaders for military uses.</p>

<p>Its old men, women, and children, who survived
the slaughter of invasion, are now undertaking the
labour of restoring their farms. To help in the
supply of seeds, farm implements, and other simple
but essential means of enabling these suffering
people to regain by their own efforts the necessaries
of life, the compilers offer to the public this book
on Cookery.</p>

<p>Its proceeds will be distributed by Le Secours
National, of France, whose effective organization
assures its best and most helpful disposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>An acknowledgment must be made for the kind
assistance of friends in securing desirable recipes.
There are some that will be novel to many households,
and all of them will give satisfaction when
exactly followed.</p>

<p>The compilers will gladly answer requests for
information from any one wishing further to
support this cause.</p>

<p>Vous d&eacute;sirez faire quelque chose pour venir en
aide aux victimes de la guerre en France et, dans
ce but, vous publiez un livre utile dont vous faites
tous les frais d'impression de mani&egrave;re &agrave; ce que le
produit total de la vente soit vers&eacute; au Comit&eacute; de
Secours National de Paris.</p>

<p>Le but que vous vous proposez est fort louable
car les besoins sont grands au pays de France.
On a fait derni&egrave;rement le recensement des r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s
belges et fran&ccedil;ais chass&eacute;s de leurs demeures et
recueillis dans les diverses communes de France.
Ils sont plus de 900,000 et les allemands out renvoy&eacute;
en France par la voie de la Suisse plus de
100,000 prisonniers&mdash;vieillards, femmes et enfants&mdash;qu'ils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
ne voulaient plus nourrir et qui out &eacute;t&eacute;
rendus, d&eacute;nu&eacute;s de tout, &agrave; la charit&eacute; publique.
Tous ces malheureux doivent &ecirc;tre v&ecirc;tus de la t&ecirc;te
aux pieds. Les Etats-Unis et le Canada out heureusement
fait leur part pour soulager cette grande
infortune, gr&acirc;ce aux appels r&eacute;it&eacute;r&eacute;s de l'American
Relief Clearing House de Paris et de New-York
et des divers comit&eacute;s canadiens du Secours
National de Paris, organis&eacute;s par le Comit&eacute; France-Am&eacute;rique.</p>

<p>Les h&ocirc;pitaux fran&ccedil;ais r&eacute;clament aussi, &agrave; bon
droit, notre sollicitude, car c'est la France qui
supporte le plus fort de l'assaut teuton sur la
fronti&egrave;re de l'Ouest et ses bless&eacute;s doivent d&eacute;passer
le demi million. Devant cette grande d&eacute;tresse la
Croix-Rouge am&eacute;ricaine et la Croix-Rouge canadienne
ne sont pas demeur&eacute;es indiff&eacute;rentes et des
milliers de caisses out &eacute;t&eacute; envoy&eacute;es aux h&ocirc;pitaux
fran&ccedil;ais. Malheureusement la liste des calamit&eacute;s
qui out fondu sur la France ne s'arr&ecirc;te pas l&agrave;:
tout le territore envahi par les troupes allemandes,
dont elles out &eacute;t&eacute; chass&eacute;es, qui va de la Marne &agrave;
l'Aisne, et que couvraient des centaines de villages
prosp&eacute;res dans une des r&eacute;gions les plus fertiles
et les plus riches de la France, a &eacute;t&eacute; ravag&eacute; par les
troupes ennemies. Les propri&eacute;taires de ces milliers
de fermes&mdash;vieillards, femmes et enfants&mdash;sont
revenus &agrave; leurs foyers d&eacute;truits pour relever leurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
maisons et faire produire &agrave; la terre la nourriture
dont ils ont besoin. Ils ont tout perdu: maisons,
meubles, v&ecirc;tements, animaux, instruments aratoires.
Ce sont ces derniers qui attirent particuli&egrave;rement
votre commis&eacute;ration. En face de cette
mis&egrave;re effroyable tous les c&#339;urs s'&eacute;meuvent et
chacun veut apporter son aide &agrave; ces braves gens.
Vous donnez au public une occasion facile et
agr&eacute;able de faire ce geste en mettant &agrave; sa port&eacute;e un
livre int&eacute;ressant dont le prix ira soulager les nobles
victimes de la guerre en France.</p>

<p>Je vous souhaite une forte recette. Veuillez
agr&eacute;er, mesdames, avec mes f&eacute;licitations, l'expression
de mes sentiments distingu&eacute;s.</p>

<h2>ALLIED FOOD</h2>


<p>As soon as I heard of the proposed plan of this
book I became positively frantic to co-operate
in it. The idea of a cookery book which should
contain Allied Recipes and Allied Recipes only,
struck me at once as one of the finest ideas of
the day.</p>

<p>For myself I have felt for some time past
that the time is gone, and gone for ever, when
I can eat a German Pretzel or a Wiener
Schnitzel.</p>

<p>It gives me nothing but remorse to remember
that there were days when I tolerated, I may
even say I enjoyed, Hungarian Goulash. I could
not eat it now. As for Bulgarian Boosh or Turkish
Tch'kk, the mere names of them make me
ill.</p>

<p>For me, for the rest of my life, it must be Allied
Food or no food at all. One may judge, therefore,
with what delight I received the news of this
patriotic enterprise. I at once telegraphed to
the editors the following words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am willing to place at your service without
charge entire knowledge of cookery. Forty-six
years' practical experience."</p>

<p>To this telegram I received no reply. I am
aware that there is, even in cooking circles, a certain
amount of professional jealousy. It may be
that I had overpassed the line of good taste in
offering my entire knowledge. I should have only
offered part of it.</p>

<p>I therefore resolved that instead of writing the
whole book as I had at first intended, I would content
myself with sending to the editors, a certain
number of selected recipes of a kind calculated to
put the book in a class all by itself.</p>

<p>I sent, in all, fifty recipes. I regret to say that
after looking over the pages of the book with
the greatest care, and after looking also on the
back of them, I do not find my recipes included
in it. The obvious conclusion is that while this
book was in the press my recipes were stolen out
of it.</p>

<p>The various dishes that I had selected were of
so distinctive a character and the art involved in
their preparation so entirely <i>recherch&eacute;</i> that it
seems a pity that they should be altogether lost.
They contained a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i> which
would have marked them out as emphatically
the perquisite of the few. To say that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
were dishes for a king is to understate the fact.</p>

<p>It is therefore merely in the public interest and
from no sense of personal vanity that I reproduce
the substance of one or two of them in this preface.
There was a whole section, for example, on Eggs,
which I am extremely loath to lose. It showed how
by holding an egg down under boiling water till it
is exhausted, it may be first cooked and then be
passed under a flat iron until it becomes an Egg
Pancake. It may be then given a thin coat of
varnish and served in a railway restaurant for
years and years.</p>

<p>I had also an excellent recipe for Rum Omelette.
It read: "Take a dipper full of rum and insert an
omelette in it. Serve anywhere in Ontario." I
am convinced that this recipe alone would have
been worth its weight in rum.</p>

<p>But it would be childish of me to lay too much
stress on my own personal disappointment or regret.
When I realized what had happened I felt at once
that my co-operation in this book must take some
other form. I therefore sent to the editors a
second telegram which read:</p>

<p>"Am willing to eat free of charge all dishes
contained in volume."</p>

<p>This offer was immediately accepted, and I am
happy to assure readers of this book that I have
eaten each and every one of the preparations in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
pages that follow. To prevent all doubt I make
this statement under oath. I had intended to
make merely an honest statement of the fact
but my friends tell me that a statement under
oath is better in such a case than a mere honest
statement.</p>

<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<div class='poem'>
God what a world! if men in street and mart<br />
Felt that same impulse of the human heart<br />
Which makes them in the hour of flame and flood<br />
Rise to the meaning of true Brotherhood!<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> heart of the world throbs with sympathy
for the suffering women and children in the war-devastated
countries of Europe. He who does not
long to be a helper in this hour of vast need and
unprecedented anguish must be made of something
more adamant than stone. America owes a large
debt to the culinary artists of Europe. Without
their originality and finished skill, in the creation
of savory dishes for the table, the art of entertaining
in our land could never have attained its
present perfection.</p>

<p>Ever ready to incorporate in her own methods
whatever other countries had to offer as improvements,
America has received from the epicurean
chefs of Europe conspicuous benefits. In every menu
from coast to coast, these facts make themselves
evident. It is then fitting, that at this crucial
hour, we repay something of the debt we owe by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
making this little cooking manual an instant and
decided success, knowing the proceeds from its
sale will relieve such distress as we in our sheltered
homes can scarcely picture by the greatest effort
of imagination.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Our souls should be vessels receiving<br />
The waters of love for relieving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sorrows of men.</span><br />
For here lies the pleasure of living:<br />
In taking God's bounties and giving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gifts back again.</span><br />

<h2>CHARLOTTE DE POMMES</h2>


<p>Prendre des pommes reinettes &eacute;p&eacute;pin&eacute;es, &eacute;minc&eacute;es
et saut&eacute;es au beurre avec quelques pinc&eacute;es du
sucre et une demi-gousse de vanille.</p>

<p>De cette fondue de pommes qui ne doit pas &ecirc;tre
trop cuite, on garnit un moule &agrave; charlotte dont les
parois auront &eacute;t&eacute; rev&ecirc;tues d'&eacute;troites tranches de
mie de pain tremp&eacute;es dans du beurre &eacute;pur&eacute; et
saupoudr&eacute; de sucre.</p>

<p>Ces tranches de pain doivent &ecirc;tre plac&eacute;es dans
le moule, se chevauchant, les unes sur les autres.</p>

<p>Garnir le fond du moule d'une abaisse de pain
de mie &eacute;galement beurr&eacute;e et saupoudr&eacute;e de sucre.</p>

<p>Recouvrir la charlotte d'une abaisse prise dans
la cro&ucirc;te du pain de mie afin de la prot&eacute;ger contre
l'action trop vive du calorique.</p>

<p>Faire cuire la charlotte au four pendant 35 ou
40 minutes; la laisser reposer pendant quelques
minutes &agrave; l'&eacute;tuve avant de la d&eacute;mouler, et la servir
avec une sauce &agrave; l'abricot, parfum&eacute;e au Kirsch.</p>

<h3>BOUILLABAISSE</h3>

<div class='sub'>(The national dish of Marseille)</div>

<div class='poem'>
Indeed, a rich and savory stew 'tis;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And true philosophers, methinks,</span><br />
Who love all sorts of natural beauties,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should love good victuals and good drinks.</span><br />
And Cordelier or Benedictine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace,</span><br />
Nor find a fast day too afflicting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which served him up a Bouillabaisse.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><span class="smcap">Thackeray.</span></span><br />
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/letter-c.jpg" width="20" height="24" alt="C" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">Cut off the best parts of 3 medium-sized flounders
and 6 butterfish and put them aside; the remaining
parts of the fish&mdash;skin, bones, heads, etc.&mdash;boil in
water 20 minutes; this should make 1 quart of
fish stock when strained.</div>

<p>Put 3 tablespoons of olive oil in stew-pan, add
4 chopped onions, 3 cloves of chopped garlic, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
few sprigs of parsley, 1 bayleaf, &frac14; teaspoon fennel,
&frac14; teaspoon saffron, &frac12; teaspoon whole black
pepper ground, salt, fry until golden brown. Then
add 3 or 4 tomatoes and a pimento, <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></small> quart of
white wine, <small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></small> quart of water, boil 15 minutes.
Strain and return to the kettle; add the flounder
and butterfish in pieces as large as possible, &frac12; lb.
of codfish tongues, 1 lb. of eel; boil 10 minutes, add
the fish stock, 1 lb. of scallops, boil 10 more minutes.
Rub together 1 oz. of flour and 1 oz. of butter; drop
this in the soup in little balls five minutes before
serving. Then put in &frac12; lb. of shrimps and 1 large
boiled lobster cut in large pieces. Rub with garlic
some round slices of bread and serve the Bouillabaisse
on them.</p>

<p>This will serve 12 persons.</p>

<p>One is not able to obtain here the varieties of
fish of the Midi, but the above will make an excellent
substitute.</p>


<h3>BORCHT</h3>

<div class='sub'>(Russian)</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/letter-m.jpg" width="34" height="25" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">Make a clear, light-coloured, highly seasoned
stock of beef and veal or of chicken. Strain and
remove all fat. A Russian gourmet will say that
really good Borcht should be made with 2 ducks
and a chicken in the stock. Cut up some red
beets and boil them in the stock; about 4 large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
beets to 8 cups of stock. When the beets are
cooked squeeze in enough lemon-juice to give it a
slightly acid flavour, then clear by stirring in the
whipped white of an egg and bringing it to the
boiling point. Strain carefully. Serve in cups
with a spoonful of sour cream. If the colour fails
to be bright red, a few drops of vegetable colouring
may be added.</div>


<h3>MUSHROOM SOUP</h3>

<div class='sub'>(French)</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/letter-t.jpg" width="20" height="25" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">Three-quarters lb. of fresh mushrooms, 1 cup of
water, 2 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of
flour, 4 cups of scalded milk, &frac12; cup of cream, a
few gratings of nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</div>

<p>Put the mushrooms in a stew-pan with 1 tablespoon
of butter, a few gratings of nutmeg, salt,
and pepper, and 1 cup of water; cook over a good
fire 20 minutes, then pass through a coarse sieve.
Cream 1 tablespoon of butter with 2 tablespoons

<h3>INDIAN CURRY</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/letter-m.jpg" width="34" height="25" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">Most of the curry powder or paste to be found
in this part of the world is a mixture of &frac14; of
dried chilli, &frac14; coriander, &frac12; dagatafolum; but
the native curry cook uses a much larger variety
of spices and likes to grind them himself fresh daily
between two stones. The spices commonly used
are:</div>

<div class='poem'>
Red chilli (roasted)<br />
Coriander seed (roasted)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; "&nbsp; (fresh)</span><br />
Cinnamon<br />
Nutmeg<br />
Baked garlic<br />
Scraped cocoanut<br />
Dagatafolum<br />
Caraway seed<br />
Yellow pimentos<br />
Red pimentos<br />
Cardamon seeds<br />
Curcuma (saffron root)<br />
</div>


<h3>A FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN</h3>

<div class='sub'>(Ceylon style)</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/letter-c.jpg" width="20" height="24" alt="C" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">Cut 2 good-sized chickens in 8 pieces. Season
with salt and pepper; put in a saucepan with
about 1 quart of cocoanut milk; add to this a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
cinnamon, &frac14; teaspoon fresh coriander, &frac14; teaspoon
of powdered saffron, a little red pimento, and
boil until tender; at the last minute thicken the
sauce with 4 yolks of eggs mixed well with &frac12; pint
cocoanut cream; keep hot but do not boil, as the
richness of the ingredients would make it curdle.
As this curry is not hot it is served with a sambo
which consists of small dishes on one tray containing
such savories as plain scraped cocoanut,
pimento paste, and chopped onion with a red
pepper sauce.</div>

<p>To obtain cocoanut cream, use the same process
as that for ordinary cream;&mdash;as for the milk: have
3 fresh cocoanuts scraped very fine to which you
add 3 pints of water, stir together for a few moments,
then strain, let this milk stand for 3 hours
to obtain the cream.</p>


<h3>A SIMPLER INDIAN CURRY</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/letter-o.jpg" width="18" height="24" alt="O" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">One lb. of beef, mutton, fish, or vegetables, as
desired. One tablespoon of curry powder, 1 heaping
tablespoon of butter, 1 onion, &frac12; fresh cocoanut,
juice of half a lemon, salt to taste. Curry powder
to be mixed in 2 ozs. of water. Onion to be finely
chopped. Cocoanut to be scraped and soaked in
a teacup of boiling water, then squeezed, and the
milk (or the liquid) to be put in the curry. First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
cook the butter till it bubbles, put in the onion
and let it brown, add the curry powder, and let
that cook a few minutes; if it becomes too dry
and sticks to the pan add a little hot water.
Then put in the meat (raw), cut in small pieces,
fish, or vegetables, and fry them, add salt, and if
dry, add a little more water, let all simmer till
meat is thoroughly done; when about half done,
add the cocoanut milk and the lemon-juice.</div>

<p>If not convenient to use the cocoanut milk, ordinary
milk can be used, and the mixture thickened
with a little flour. Cocoanut milk thickens without
flour. When the butter separates and shows
itself in the gravy, the curry is ready for serving.
Curry should be served with plain boiled rice.
Pass rice first, then curry.</p>

<p>If Indian chutney is served with curry it is a
great addition. A banana may be cut up in pieces
about half-inch thick, and added to the curry mixture
while cooking, and is a pleasant addition to
the flavour.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER CURRY SAUCE</h3>

oz. of butter about 10 minutes, but do not let them
brown. Add 1 dessert-spoonful of mild curry
powder, the grated rind and juice of &frac12; a lemon, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>&frac12;
pint of water or stock, some salt, and 1 tablespoonful
of seedless raisins, and simmer until the onion
is quite tender. Unless added to rice or paste put
in 1 dessert-spoonful of flour after the onion and
apple have cooked about 10 minutes.</div>

layer of squares of Indian meal close together, to
entirely cover the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle
over it grated cheese; then pour on the top enough
meat sauce to cover the layer (about 2 tablespoons),
then on the top of this add a layer of B&eacute;chamel
sauce. Then put another layer of the squares
of Indian meal, sprinkle with grated cheese as
